# Introduction
This is a project done for my Machine Learning course at NUS. It aims to classify whether a credit card application should be approved based on the applicant's personal information, using [Credit Card Approval Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction) dataset from Kaggle. Project is coded with Python using Jupyter Notebook on Google Collab.

Multiple ML models are trained using scikit-learn, including KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM. We also trained a Neural Network with Tensorflow. The best performing model is found to be Random Forest.
